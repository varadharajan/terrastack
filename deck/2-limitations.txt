Limitations:
- Snowflake environments and time consuming devbox setup process.
- Difficult to test changes without a shared environment
    * A task that should take few minutes takes few hours at the end
- Difficult to reproduce issues on local boxes for debugging purposes.
- Major portions of IaC code have side-effects (example: Provisioning a S3 bucket) making it difficult to write tests.
    * IaC frameworks are still in its early stages compared to traditional platforms like the JVM when it comes to developer support tools.
- Expensive ($)
